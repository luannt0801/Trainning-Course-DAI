    "In this part of the Lab, you will implement a very simplified version of the Random Forest classifier. Random Forst (RF) works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a dataset $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, RF selects randomly some features (i.e. `n_features`) from the dataset (where `n_features << d`). It also selects a random subset of the data (with `n_samples` data-points). Then, it builds a Decision Tree from those selected features and samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeats this process `n_trees` times so that you have a number of `n_trees` Decision Trees built from different random combinations of features and different random subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To predict, RF takes each of the `n_trees` built Decision Trees and predict the outputs (classes); then it calculates the votes for each predicted class-label and takes the mode (most frequent label). In other words, considers the high voted predicted label as the final prediction from the random forest algorithm.\n",
