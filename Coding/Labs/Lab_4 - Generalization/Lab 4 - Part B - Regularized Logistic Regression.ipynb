    "In this part of the Lab, you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance. During quality assurance, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the data\n",
    "This dataset is the same as the one you used previously in the Lab about kNN classification. We have a file `microchips-dataset.csv` which contains the dataset for our classification problem. The first column corresponds to the result of *\"microchip test 1\"*, the second column corresponds to the result of *\"microchip test 2\"*, and the third column is the class-label indicating if the microchip has been accepted or rejected (1 = Accepted, 0 = Rejected).\n",

    "The following Python code loads the dataset from the csv file into the variables $X$ (input data matrix) and $y$ (output class-labels). The variable $X$ should be a matrix (as a numpy array) with $n$ lines and two columns (two feature) corresponding to *\"microchip test 1\"* and *\"microchip test 2\"*. The variable $y$ should be a numpy array of $n$ elements. Read the code and run it.\n",

    "## Feature mapping\n",
    "From the previous visualization, you can see that our dataset cannot be separated into positive (class 1) and negative (class 0) examples by a straight-line through the plot. Therefore, a straightforward application of logistic regression will not perform well on this dataset since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary. As you might know, one way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data-point by mapping the features into polynomial terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$ (e.g. $x_1^2$, $x_1 x_2$, etc ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following provided function `mapFeature(..)` maps the features into all polynomial terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$ up to the sixth power. As a result of this mapping, our vector of two features (the scores on two QA tests) has been transformed into a 28-dimensional vector (including an additional first $1$, so you don't need to add it). So, for a 2-dimensional data-point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ from the dataset $X$, it's mapped version in the new dataset `X_poly` is as follows:\n",

    "A logistic regression classifier trained on this higher-dimension feature-vector will have a more complex decision boundary and will appear nonlinear when drawn in our 2-dimensional plot. While the feature mapping allows us to build a more expressive classifier, it also more susceptible to overfitting. In the next parts of the Lab, you will implement regularized logistic regression to fit the data and also see for yourself how regularization can help combat the overfitting problem."
