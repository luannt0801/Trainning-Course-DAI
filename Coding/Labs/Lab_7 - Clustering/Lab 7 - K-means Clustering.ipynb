    "In this Lab, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. Before starting on the Lab, we strongly recommend reading the slides of lecture 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will first start on an example 2D dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that, you wil use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Implementing K-means\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data examples together. Concretely, you are given a training set $\\{ x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(n)} \\}$ (where $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$), and want to group the data into a few cohesive \"*clusters*\". The intuition behind K-means is an iterative procedure that starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then refines this guess by repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids and then recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize centroids\n",
    "centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K)\n",
    "for itr in range(0, iterations):\n",
    "    # \"Cluster assignment\" step: Assign each data point to the closest centroid. \n",
    "    # idx[i] corresponds to the index of the centroid assigned to data-point i\n",
    "    idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # \"Move centroid\" step: Compute means based on centroid assignments\n",
    "    centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps: (i) Assigning each training example $x^{(i)}$ to its closest centroid, and (ii) Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it. The K-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids. Note that the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids. Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement the two phases of the K-means algorithm separately in the next sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Finding closest centroids\n",
    "In the \"cluster assignment\" phase of the K-means algorithm, the algorithm assigns every training example $x^{(i)}$ to its closest centroid, given the current positions of centroids. Specifically, for every example $i$ we set\n",
    "$$c^{(i)} = j \\text{ that minimizes } \\left \\| x^{(i)} - \\mu_j \\right \\|^2$$\n",
    "where $c^{(i)}$ is the index of the centroid that is closest to $x^{(i)}$, and $\\mu_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the position (vector of values) of the $j^{th}$ centroid. Note that $c^{(i)}$ corresponds to `idx[i]` in the algorithm shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to complete the function `findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)` in the following Python code. This function takes the data matrix $X$ and the centroids inside `centroids` and should output a one-dimensional array `idx` that holds the index (a value in $\\{1, \\dots, K\\}$ where $K$ is total number of centroids) of the closest centroid to every training example.

    "<img src=\"datasets/bird_small.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will apply K-means to image compression. In a straightforward 24-bit color representation of an image, each pixel is represented as three 8-bit unsigned integers (ranging from 0 to 255) that specify the red, green and blue intensity values. This encoding is often refered to as the RGB encoding. Our image contains thousands of colors, and in this part of the Lab, you will reduce the number of colors to 16 colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making this reduction, it is possible to represent (compress) the photo in an effcient way. Specifically, you only need to store the RGB values of the 16 selected colors, and for each pixel in the image you now need to only store the index of the color at that location (where only 4 bits are necessary to represent 16 possibilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will use the K-means algorithm to select the 16 colors that will be used to represent the compressed image. Concretely, you will treat every pixel in the original image as a data example and use the K-means algorithm to find the 16 colors that best group (cluster) the pixels in the 3-dimensional RGB space. Once you have computed the cluster centroids on the image, you will then use the 16 colors to replace the pixels in the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. K-means on pixels\n",
    "In Python, images can be read as follows `A = plt.imread('image.png')`. For RGB images, this function creates a three-dimensional matrix $A$ of shape `(p, q, 3)` where $p \\times q$ is the number of pixels in the image, and each element `A[i][j]` (corresponding to the pixel at row $i$ and column $j$) is a 3-dimensional vector containing the RGB (*red*, *green*, *blue*) intensities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider each pixel as a 3-dimensional data-point. Therefore, the number of data-points we have is the number of pixels in the image (i.e. $n = p \\times q$). For example, for an RGB image of $128 \\times 128 = 16384 = n$ pixels, our dataset is $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16384 \\times 3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python code first loads the image, and then reshapes it to create an $n \\times 3$ matrix of pixels (where $n = 16384 = 128 \\times 128$), and calls the `Kmeans(..)` function on it to cluster the pixel colors into 16 clusters. This clustering process may take some time (few seconds or minutes) as we have 16384 data-points (pixels). After finding the top K = 16 colors to represent the image, we can now assign each pixel to its closest centroid using the `findClosestCentroids(..)` function. This allows us to represent the original image using the centroid assignments of each pixel and plot the new image. The image that you will get is shown in the following figure.\n",

    "<img src=\"imgs/KmeansCompressedBird.png\" width=\"350px\" />\n",

The original image required 24 bits for each one of the $128 \\times 128$ pixel locations, while the new representation requires only requires 4 bits per pixel location. The final number of bits used would correspond to compressing the original image by about a factor of 6 (i.e. we eliminated $\\sim 83\\%$ of the original size).\n",

    "**Your Task:** Once you read the code and run it and see the results, you can then try to run it with a smaller value of $K$ (e.g. $k = 10, K = 5, K = 2$) and see the results again."
