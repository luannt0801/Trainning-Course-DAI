    "Classifiers such as logistic regression cannot directly form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classifier. In this Lab, you will implement a neural network from scrach to recognize handwritten digits. The neural network will be able to result in a complex model that forms a non-linear hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, you will be using parameters from a neural network that we have already trained. Your goal is to implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our provided weights for prediction. Then, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for learning the neural network parameters (i.e. weights) and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.\n",

    "# 1. Dataset and Visualization\n",
    "For this Lab, you will use a dataset to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks automatically. This Lab will show you how the methods you've learned can be used for this classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a data set in `digits-dataset.mat` that contains $n = 5000$ training examples of handwritten digits. Each training example is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ where $d=400$, resulting from a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. In order words, each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location; the 20 by 20 grid of pixels was \"*unrolled*\" (i.e. flattened) into a 400-dimensional vector. So, each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix $X$. This gives us a $5000 \\times 400$ matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5000 \\times 400}$ where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the training set is a vector $y$ of dimension 5000, that contains labels for the training set. For some reason, the digit zero is mapped to the output value 10. Therefore, a 0 digit is labeled as 10, while the digits 1 to 9 are labeled as 1 to 9 in their natural order.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that our inputs are pixel values of digit images. Since the images are of size $20 \\times 20$, this gives us $400$ input layer units (not counting the extra bias unit which is always $+1$). So, if we feed just **one data-point** $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{400}$ to our input layer, then we should have $a^{(1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{401}$. However, if we stack **all our $n$ data-points** as columns into a matrix $X^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{400 \\times n}$ (i.e. transpose of the original $X$ matrix) and add the extra feature $x_0 = 1$ to each data-point (i.e. add a row of ones to $X^T$), then our input layer would be $a^{(1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{401 \\times n}$.\n",

In this multi-class classification problem, for each input vector $x$, the output layer $a^{(3)}$ should output a $K$ dimensional vector. Therefore, we should encode each of our class-labels $y^{(i)}$ (from $y$) as a **one-hot-vector** of dimension $K$. In other words, the labels vector $y$ of dimension $n$ should be encoded as a matrix $Y$ of dimension $K \\times n$.\n",

    "## 2.1 Some Useful Functions\n",
    "Before proceeding, we first provide in this section some useful functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function is `add_row_ones(A)`. It takes a given matrix `A` (two dimensional numpy array) and returns a new matrix based on `A` with an additional first row of ones. This will be helpful later, for example, when you want to feed the data to the input layer. Remember that $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n}$ (in our digits dataset $d=400, n=5000$) and $a^{(1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(d+1) \\times n}$. So, to feed the dataset to the input layer, we can transpose $X$ and add a row of ones to it: `add_row_ones(X.T)` (which would be in $\\mathbb{R}^{(d+1) \\times n}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second function is `vectorize_outputs(y)`. It takes an array of class-labels $y$ and returns a matrix $Y$ where the $i^{th}$ column in $Y$ corresponds to the one-hot-vector of the $i^{th}$ class-label $y^{(i)}$ in $y$. This will be helpful later when we want to compare the output of the last layer $a^{(3)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times n}$ to the true output $Y  \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third function is `sigmoid(z)`. It computes the sigmoid defined as: $\\text{sigmoid}(z) = g(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$. This function works when the argument $z$ is a scalar value, a vector, or a matrix. For a vector or a matrix, the function will perform the sigmoid function on every element. This function will be useful later on when you implement feedforward and backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forth function is `sigmoid_deriv(z)` which is the derivative of the sigmoid function defined as: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} g(z) = g(z) (1 - g(z))$. This function works when the argument $z$ is a scalar value, a vector, or a matrix. For a vector or a matrix, the function will apply the derivative on every element. This function will be useful later on when you implement backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to implement anything in this section. Just read the code before running it to understand what each function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** In this lab we are using the sigmoid function as an activation function for our hidden layer just for an educational purpose. However, you should be aware that it is usually **not** a good idea to use the sigmoid activation function for the hidden layers (especially if you have several hidden layers), as it may suffer from the **vanishing gradient problem**. In reality, it is usually better to use a simpler activation function such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and have more hidden layers.

    "Recall that the intuition behind the backpropagation algorithm is as follows. Given a training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$, we will first run a \"*forward pass*\" to compute all the activations throughout the network, including the output value of the hypothesis $h_\\Theta(x)$. Then, for each node $j$ in layer $l$, we would like to compute an \"*error term*\" $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ that measures how much that node was \"responsible\" for any errors in our output.\n",

For the hidden units, you will compute $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ based on a weighted average of the error terms of the nodes in layer $(l + 1)$, as depicted in the above figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more details, here is how the neural network training works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the function `neural_network_training(..)` given below, we encode $y$ (the true class-labels) as a matrix $Y$ (as explained previously); we use the input data $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n ~ \\times ~ d}$) to set our input layer `a1` $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{(d+1) ~ \\times ~ n}$; then, we initialize the parameters matrices `Theta1` and `Theta2` randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We iterate several times with a loop `for itr in range(max_iterations): ...` until convergence or until we reach `max_iterations`. At each iteration we do the following:\n",
    "  1. We perform a feedforward propagation pass in order to compute the activations $(z^{(2)}, a^{(2)}, z^{(3)}; a^{(3)})$ for layers 2 and 3 using our previously defined function: `z2, a2, z3, a3 = feedforward(a1, Theta1, Theta2)`.\n",
    "  2. We perform a backpropagation pass in order to compute the gradients `D1` and `D2`, using the backpropagation function defined below: `D1, D2 = backpropagation(a1, z2, a2, z3, a3, Y, Theta1, Theta2)`.\n",
    "  3. We perform a gradient descent step to update the matrices parameters `Theta1` and `Theta2`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "The backpropagation function `backpropagation(a1, z2, a2, z3, a3, Y, Theta1, Theta2)` is given to you in the following code. You are asked to read it and understand how it works. Here is some explanation to help you better understand it:\n",
    "1. First, we compute the erros (`delta3`) at the output layer as follows: $\\delta^{(3)} = (a^{(3)} - Y)$. This is possible since $a^{(3)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K ~ \\times ~ n}$ and $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K ~ \\times ~ n}$ are of the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For layer 2 (our hidden layer), we first need to compute $(\\Theta^{(2)})^T \\delta^{(3)}$. Notice that $\\Theta_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K ~ \\times ~ (\\text{hunits+1})}$ and $\\delta^{(3)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K ~ \\times ~ n}$, so the product $(\\Theta^{(2)})^T \\delta^{(3)}$ is possible and the result `result_temp = (Theta2.T @ delta3)` will be in $\\mathbb{R}^{(\\text{hunits+1}) ~ \\times ~ n}$. Next, we ignore the first row from this result as it is associated with the additional bias unit: `result_temp = result_temp[1:]`. Then, we need to elementwise-multiply this result with $g'(z^{(2)})$, where $g'(.)$ is the derivative of the activation function (i.e. `sigmoid_deriv(z2)`). This is done with `delta2 =  result_temp * sigmoid_deriv(z2)`. Note that this elementwise multiplication is possible as $g'(z^{(2)}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\text{hunits} ~ \\times ~ n}$. Also, note that there is no $\\delta^{(1)}$ to compute, as layer 1 corresponds to our input data (which does not change).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, the (unregularized) gradients $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Theta_{ij}^{(l)}} E(\\Theta)$ with respect to the parameters of $\\Theta^{(l)}$ are obtained in $\\Delta^{(l)}$ (which is of the same dimensions as $\\Theta^{(l)}$) using the formula: $$\\Delta^{(l)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\big [ \\delta^{(l+1)} (a^{(l)})^T \\big ].$$ In the code below, `DELTA1` corresponds to $\\Delta^{(1)}$, and `DELTA2` corresponds to $\\Delta^{(2)}$.\n"
